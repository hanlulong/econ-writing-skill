## 1. Abstract

**Topic:** The effect of immigration on native wages

### BEFORE

> The question of how immigration affects native-born workers' wages has been an important and much-debated topic in the field of labor economics for several decades. In this paper, the relationship between immigration and wages is investigated using a novel dataset that was recently made available. It is found that there are several interesting and noteworthy results regarding the impact of immigration on wages across different skill groups. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of current policy debates about immigration reform. This paper contributes to the existing body of literature by utilizing a new identification strategy that addresses some of the endogeneity concerns that have been raised in prior studies. Our analysis suggests that additional research on this topic would be valuable.

**(98 words of nothing concrete)**

### AFTER

> I estimate the causal effect of immigration on native wages using the unexpected resettlement of 120,000 Syrian refugees across Turkish provinces in 2012-2013 as a natural experiment. Combining province-level administrative wage records with a shift-share instrument based on pre-existing ethnic networks, I find that a 10 percentage point increase in the immigrant share of the labor force reduces native wages by 2.3% (SE = 0.7) in the short run. The effect is concentrated among workers without a high school diploma, whose wages fall by 4.1%. These estimates imply that the average Turkish worker lost approximately $380 in annual earnings, while employers gained $1.2 billion in reduced labor costs.

### What changed

- **Concrete, not abstract (Rule 4):** Replaced "several interesting results" with actual coefficients (2.3%, 4.1%), standard errors, and dollar magnitudes.
- **Active voice (Rule 6):** Changed "it is found that" and "the relationship is investigated" to "I estimate" and "I find."
- **Abstract formula (What/How/Findings/Implications):** Structured as research question, then method and data, then central finding, then implication.
- **No throat-clearing:** Deleted the entire first sentence about decades of debate.
- **Every word counts (Rule 5):** Cut from vague 98 words to dense 109 words that actually say something.
- **Identification strategy named:** "shift-share instrument" gives the reader immediate methodological context.

## 2. Introduction Opening

**Topic:** Returns to education in developing countries

### BEFORE

> Education has long been recognized as one of the most important determinants of economic well-being. Since the seminal work of Mincer (1974), economists have devoted considerable attention to understanding the relationship between schooling and earnings. The human capital literature has grown substantially over the past several decades, with researchers employing a wide variety of methodological approaches to estimate the returns to education. Given the importance of education policy for developing countries, and given that governments in these countries allocate a significant share of their budgets to education, it is crucial to have reliable estimates of the returns to schooling. In this context, the present paper seeks to contribute to this important body of literature by examining the returns to education in Indonesia. More specifically, we utilize data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey to investigate how an additional year of schooling affects earnings for Indonesian workers.

**(148 words before the reader learns what the paper does)**

### AFTER

> In 2015, the Indonesian government spent 20% of its national budget -- $38 billion -- on education, yet policymakers had no credible causal estimate of what an additional year of schooling actually delivers for Indonesian workers. This paper fills that gap. I exploit the staggered rollout of Indonesia's 1973 school construction program, which built 61,000 primary schools across districts at different rates, as an instrument for years of schooling. Using five waves of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (1993-2014, N = 34,200), I find that each additional year of schooling increases annual earnings by 9.4% (SE = 1.8) -- roughly $620 at mean income levels. This return is 40% larger than the OLS estimate of 6.7%, consistent with downward ability bias in developing-country settings where the least-able students are often pushed into schooling by family labor allocation decisions.

**(142 words -- the reader knows the question, method, data, and main result)**

### What changed

- **No throat-clearing (Rule: Hook with a fact):** Replaced five sentences of "education has long been important" with a specific, striking fact ($38 billion, 20% of budget) that immediately establishes why the question matters.
- **Triangular style (Rule 2):** The most important information -- what the paper does and finds -- appears in sentences 2-5, not at the end.
- **Concrete results in the introduction:** The actual coefficient (9.4%), standard error, dollar magnitude ($620), and comparison to OLS (6.7%) all appear in the opening paragraph.
- **Active voice (Rule 6):** "I exploit," "I find" instead of "we utilize," "it is crucial."
- **Hook strategy -- Y is big:** The $38 billion spending figure hooks the reader without resorting to philosophy or literature summaries.

## 3. Literature Review

**Topic:** The effect of minimum wage on employment

### BEFORE

> There is a large literature on the effects of minimum wage on employment. Card and Krueger (1994) study the effect of the minimum wage increase in New Jersey on fast-food employment and find a positive effect on employment. Neumark and Wascher (2000) use different data and find that minimum wage increases reduce employment. Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) use contiguous county pairs along state borders and find no significant employment effects. Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer (2019) use a bunching estimator and find small disemployment effects. Jardim, Long, Plotnick, van Inwegen, Vigdor, and Wething (2022) study the Seattle minimum wage increase and find negative employment effects for low-wage workers. Harasztosi and Lindner (2019) study the Hungarian minimum wage increase and find negative employment effects. Overall, the literature is mixed, and further research is needed to understand the employment effects of the minimum wage.

**(162 words that tell no story)**

### AFTER

> The employment effect of minimum wage increases has been contested since Card and Krueger (1994) found that New Jersey's 1992 increase raised fast-food employment -- contradicting the standard competitive model. Neumark and Wascher (2000) challenged this finding on data-quality grounds, and the subsequent two decades of research have largely been a methodological refinement of this debate. The most influential resolution comes from Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), who argue that earlier studies conflated regional employment trends with minimum wage effects; their contiguous-county design eliminates this bias and finds near-zero employment effects. Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer (2019) extend this approach nationally and confirm that minimum wage increases up to 59% of the median wage cause little detectable job loss.
>
> However, two recent studies suggest that larger increases may behave differently. Jardim, Long, Plotnick, van Inwegen, Vigdor, and Wething (2022) find that Seattle's increase to $13 -- which reached 72% of the median wage -- reduced hours for low-wage workers by 9%. Harasztosi and Lindner (2019) document similar disemployment effects for Hungary's 60% minimum wage increase. These findings suggest a threshold above which the competitive model reasserts itself, but no study has tested this threshold hypothesis directly. This paper does so.

**(194 words that build a narrative arc and establish a niche)**

### What changed

- **Story, not enumeration (Rule: Literature review tells a story):** Replaced "X found A. Y found B. Z found C." with a narrative that has a beginning (Card and Krueger's surprise), a middle (methodological refinement), and a turning point ("however").
- **Establishes a niche:** The "however" pivot identifies a gap (no direct test of the threshold hypothesis), and "This paper does so" fills it. The old version ended with the empty phrase "further research is needed."
- **Intellectual development:** The review explains *why* different studies reach different conclusions (methodology, wage level), not just *that* they disagree.
- **Generous credit (Rule: Be generous in citations):** Each paper's contribution is explained substantively rather than reduced to a one-line summary.
- **No abbreviations of author names:** Full names throughout.

## 4. Results Paragraph

**Topic:** The effect of trade liberalization on firm productivity

### BEFORE

> Table 3 presents the estimation results of the effect of trade liberalization on firm productivity. The results are obtained from the estimation of equation (4) utilizing the methodology described in section 3.2. In column (1), the baseline specification is presented. It can be seen that the coefficient on tariff reduction is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. This indicates that tariff reductions are associated with increases in firm productivity. In column (2), we add firm-level controls including firm size, capital intensity, and export status. The coefficient remains statistically significant. In column (3), we interact tariff reduction with initial productivity quartile. The interaction terms suggest that the effects are heterogeneous across the productivity distribution. In column (4), industry-year fixed effects are included, and the results remain robust to this specification. These results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the model presented in section 2.

**(157 words -- the reader still doesn't know how big the effect is)**

### AFTER

> Tariff reductions substantially raise firm productivity. A 10 percentage point cut in input tariffs increases revenue-based TFP by 6.2% (SE = 1.4), as shown in column (1) of Table 3. This estimate is stable across specifications: adding firm-level controls for size, capital intensity, and export status yields an estimate of 5.8% (column 2), and including industry-by-year fixed effects gives 5.5% (column 4). To put these magnitudes in context, the average Indian tariff fell by 32 percentage points between 1991 and 2001, implying a cumulative productivity gain of 18-20% for the median firm -- roughly equivalent to an additional decade of organic productivity growth.
>
> The gains are concentrated among initially low-productivity firms. Firms in the bottom quartile of the pre-reform productivity distribution see TFP gains of 11.3% per 10 percentage point tariff cut, compared to 2.1% for firms in the top quartile (column 3, p-value of difference < 0.01). This pattern is consistent with an import-competition mechanism: less productive firms face the strongest competitive pressure to upgrade technology when tariff protection is removed.

**(178 words -- the reader immediately knows the magnitude, robustness, and economic significance)**

### What changed

- **Magnitude first / no buried lead (Rule 2, Rule 4):** The first sentence states the finding. The second sentence gives the actual number (6.2%). The old version made readers wade through methodological references before revealing any magnitude.
- **Economic significance (Rule: Explain economic significance, not just statistical):** The 18-20% cumulative gain and "equivalent to an additional decade of organic productivity growth" translate the coefficient into something meaningful.
- **Active voice (Rule 6):** "Tariff reductions raise" instead of "it can be seen that the coefficient is negative." Tables and figures as subjects: "column (1) of Table 3" rather than "the baseline specification is presented."
- **No cross-references to methodology sections:** Deleted "utilizing the methodology described in section 3.2" and "consistent with the theoretical predictions of the model presented in section 2" -- these add nothing.
- **Concrete heterogeneity:** Instead of "the effects are heterogeneous," the revision states 11.3% vs. 2.1% with a p-value.

## 5. Conclusion

**Topic:** The effect of conditional cash transfers on child health

### BEFORE

> In this paper, we have examined the effect of conditional cash transfers on child health outcomes in rural Mexico. Our findings suggest that the program had positive effects on various health indicators. As we discussed in the preceding sections, the program appears to have been effective in improving child health. These results are important because child health is a key determinant of long-run human capital accumulation. As the literature has long recognized, investments in early childhood can have lasting effects on economic outcomes. Our results are consistent with this view. Future research could extend this analysis in several important ways. For instance, researchers could examine the long-run effects of such programs, or investigate whether similar programs would be effective in other contexts. It would also be interesting to explore the mechanisms through which these effects operate. We believe that our findings have important implications for policymakers in developing countries who are considering implementing similar programs. Overall, our results contribute to the growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of conditional cash transfer programs.

**(175 words that say the same vague thing five times)**

### AFTER

> Conditional cash transfers of $30 per month per child, conditional on regular health clinic visits, reduce stunting rates by 8 percentage points and anemia prevalence by 12 percentage points among children under five in rural Mexico. These health gains emerge within 18 months of enrollment and persist through age seven, the last point at which I observe treated children in the data.
>
> These estimates have limitations. The identification relies on the randomized rollout across 506 villages, but compliance was imperfect: 23% of treatment-group families did not meet the clinic visit requirement. My intent-to-treat estimates therefore understate the effect of actual program participation. The sample is also limited to rural communities with fewer than 2,500 residents, so the results may not generalize to peri-urban settings where health infrastructure differs.
>
> A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit calculation suggests the program passes a strict welfare test. At $360 per child per year, the reduction in stunting alone generates an estimated $4,200 in lifetime earnings gains (based on the stunting-earnings gradient in Hoddinott, Maluccio, Behrman, Flores, and Martorell 2008), yielding a benefit-cost ratio of approximately 12:1. The primary losers are taxpayers funding the transfers, though the fiscal cost is partially offset by reduced public health expenditures on childhood anemia treatment.
>
> Two extensions would strengthen these findings. First, linking treated children to administrative earnings records at age 25-30 would test whether the health gains translate into the labor market returns that the cost-benefit calculation assumes. Second, replicating the design in peri-urban Mexico or comparable Central American settings would address the external validity constraint.

**(262 words following Bellemare's four-part formula)**

### What changed

- **Bellemare's conclusion formula (Summary/Limitations/Policy/Future Research):** The revision follows all four parts in order. The original was a shapeless repetition of "our results are important."
- **Different phrasing from abstract/introduction (Rule: Do not copy-paste):** The summary uses specific numbers (8 pp stunting, 12 pp anemia, $30/month) but frames them differently -- as a cost-per-outcome statement rather than a coefficient.
- **Honest limitations (Rule: Limitations build credibility):** Specific numbers on compliance (23%) and sample restriction (< 2,500 residents) replace vague hand-waving.
- **Cost-benefit calculation (Rule: Back-of-the-envelope is fine):** The 12:1 benefit-cost ratio gives policymakers something concrete. Winners (children/society) and losers (taxpayers) are identified.
- **Concrete future research (Rule: Do not say "I leave X for future research"):** Two specific extensions with clear rationales, not a wish list. Each extension is tied to a specific limitation.
- **No speculation beyond the data (Rule):** Deleted "investments in early childhood can have lasting effects on economic outcomes" -- a claim the paper's data do not support.
- **No self-congratulation:** Deleted "our results contribute to the growing body of evidence."

## 6. General Prose

**Topic:** Monetary policy transmission

### BEFORE

> It should be noted that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through the banking channel is a complex and multifaceted process that has been the subject of extensive research in the macroeconomics and finance literatures. In order to understand how changes in the federal funds rate are transmitted to the real economy, it is necessary to consider the various channels through which monetary policy operates. The banking channel, which is sometimes also referred to as the bank lending channel, is one of the most important of these channels. Through this channel, changes in monetary policy affect the supply of loans by commercial banks, which in turn has implications for investment and consumption decisions by firms and households. In other words, when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, banks find it more costly to obtain funds, and consequently they reduce their lending activity, which has the effect of constraining economic activity.

**(148 words to say: when the Fed raises rates, banks lend less)**

### AFTER

> When the Federal Reserve raises the federal funds rate, banks face higher funding costs and reduce lending. This bank lending channel matters quantitatively: Kashyap and Stein (2000) estimate that a 100 basis point rate increase reduces commercial bank loan growth by 2.6 percentage points over the following year. The contraction is sharpest among small banks with illiquid balance sheets, whose loan growth falls by 4.1 percentage points -- nearly triple the response of large banks. Because small banks disproportionately serve small and medium enterprises, the bank lending channel amplifies the real effects of monetary policy in regions where small-firm employment is concentrated.

**(97 words that convey the mechanism, the magnitude, and the distributional implication)**

### What changed

- **Cut throat-clearing (Rule: Delete "It should be noted that"):** The first three sentences of the original ("It should be noted," "In order to understand," "is a complex and multifaceted process") say nothing. They are deleted entirely.
- **Delete "In other words" (Rule: Say it right the first time):** The original said the same thing twice. The revision says it once.
- **Active voice (Rule 6):** "Banks face higher funding costs and reduce lending" replaces "it is necessary to consider the various channels through which monetary policy operates."
- **Simple words (Rule 7):** "Raise" not "are transmitted to." "Lend less" not "reduce their lending activity, which has the effect of constraining economic activity."
- **Concrete numbers (Rule 4):** Added Kashyap and Stein's actual estimates (2.6 pp, 4.1 pp) instead of vague claims about "implications for investment and consumption decisions."
- **Every word counts (Rule 5):** Cut from 148 words to 97 words while adding more information (the small-bank heterogeneity, the regional amplification mechanism).
- **Subject-verb-object structure (Rule: Use normal sentence structure):** Short, direct sentences replace nested subordinate clauses.
